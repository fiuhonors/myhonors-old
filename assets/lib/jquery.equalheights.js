    Usage: $(object).equalHeights([minHeight], [maxHeight]);
  
    Example 1: $(".cols").equalHeights(); Sets all columns to the same height.
    Example 2: $(".cols").equalHeights(400); Sets all cols to at least 400px tall.
    Example 3: $(".cols").equalHeights(100,300); Cols are at least 100 but no more
    than 300 pixels tall. Elements with too much content will gain a scrollbar.
