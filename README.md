# MyHonors - Javascript Framework Updates Branch - NO COMMIT/MERGE
This is an attempt to update all of MyHonors Javascript dependencies, utilizing CDNs as much as possible to prioritize speed (coder can always check scripts by himself). Before working on this, please add to this branch, the latest responsive updates (in other words, when CSS3/Bootstrap 3 compliance branch is done, roll those changes here). I tried working on upgrading Angular, but a lot of stuff just broke.
