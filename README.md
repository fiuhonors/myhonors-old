# MyHonors

Developed for [The Honors College at Florida International University](http://honors.fiu.edu/).

MyHonors currently features an Events Calendar, Attendance Tracker, Citizenship Tracker, and a complete interface for [ARCH](http://honors.fiu.edu/research/conference/). It's **fast**. It's **modern**. And it's designed to be **100% responsive for use on phones, tablets, and other mobile devices**. To get a taste of what we're planning, see our Roadmap in the Development section below.

We use [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) to handle real-time data from the backend and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)--an amazing Javascript framework from Google--to power the frontend. Our HTML & CSS code is based on [Twitter Bootstrap](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

## Installation
All necessary files are already included in the repository, so you can get started with just a few steps. Note that we are assuming you use LDAP for authentication and already have an account with Firebase.

1. [Download](https://github.com/sergiopantoja/myhonors/archive/master.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/sergiopantoja/myhonors) the MyHonors repository and upload the files to your webserver.
2. Rename `auth/auth.sample.php` to `auth/auth.php`. Edit the file with the appropriate config settings.
3. Rename `application/config.sample.php` to `application/config.php`.
4. If you haven't already, install LDAP support for your server (e.g. *apt-get install php5-ldap*).
5. That's it! Login with your LDAP username/password and have fun.
